# My Unix Health 

health.sh is a script made for monitoring information on my linux servers. 
Since i access them on ssh, i either have to use my host's own monitoring tools which are mostly inaccurate in their reporting.
This will allow me to get exact readings on the system performance and other information.

If you need to try it out, set the necessary executable permissions simply by `chmod +x health.sh`

To run the script `./health.sh`
